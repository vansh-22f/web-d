console.log(a);

var a = 10;

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}





// Explain step-by-step:

// During Creation Phase:

// a is created in memory → value undefined

// greet function is fully stored in memory

// During Execution Phase:

// console.log(a) → prints undefined

// a is assigned 10

// That is why hoisting happens.
